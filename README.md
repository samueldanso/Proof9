## Story Protocol Integration

Proof9 utilizes Story Protocol for on-chain IP registration and licensing:

-   **IP Asset Registration**: `/api/registration/register` and `/api/registration/register-custom` - Register music as IP assets with commercial remix terms and royalty sharing
-   **License Token Minting**: `/api/licenses/mint` - Create transferable license tokens for commercial use
-   **Limited License Creation**: `/api/licenses/one-time-use` - Generate IP assets with constrained licensing (token limits via hooks)
-   **Royalty Management**: `/api/royalty/pay`, `/api/royalty/claim`, and `/api/royalty/transfer` - Revenue distribution and collection between IP owners
-   **IPFS Metadata Storage**: All IP and NFT metadata uploaded to IPFS with proper hashing for blockchain verification

## Yakoa Integration

Proof9 integrates Yakoa for basic music content verification:

-   **Content Registration**: `/api/verification/verify-music` - Register music tokens with Yakoa's verification service
-   **Status Monitoring**: `/api/verification/status/:tokenId` - Check verification status and infringement detection results
-   **Brand Authorization**: `/api/verification/authorize` - Manage brand permissions for licensed content
-   **Pre-Registration Verification**: Verify content authenticity before Story Protocol IP registration
